# Why Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that allows server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It is a powerful tool for creating modern web applications, with support for TypeScript, CSS-in-JS, and much more.

## How to create a Next.js project?

To create this project, it was used the command `npx create-next-app` with the options `--eslint`, `--use-yarn`, `--app`, and `--src-dir`. The following command creates a project called `portfolio-cari` with the mentioned options:

```bash
 npx create-next-app@latest [project-name] --eslint --use-yarn --app --src-dir

 # --eslint: Adds ESLint support
 # --use-yarn: Uses Yarn as package manager
 # --app: Creates a Next.js project with the default folder structure
 # --src-dir: Sets the source directory as 'src'
```
